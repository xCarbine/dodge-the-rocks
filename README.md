# dodge-the-rocks
This game was created using the "pygame" module in python.

The objective of the game is to dodge rocks falling from the sky.

The game gets faster with time. This means that the rocks will move faster, but so will the player.

Use the left and right arrows to move the player.

The player's color resembles the number of lives they have left:
Purple resembles 3 lives left.
Yellow resembles 2 lives left.
Red resembles 1 life left.

Hearts will spawn at random locations on the ground to grant the player extra lives, capped at 3.

The number on the top right is the score.

When the player loses, the game stops, but they can press 'Y' to play again.
